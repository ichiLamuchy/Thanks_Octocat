#### A DFA can be represented by a 5-tuple (Q, ∑, δ, q0, F) where −

- Q is a finite set of states.

- ∑ is a finite set of symbols called the alphabet.

- δ is the transition function where δ: Q × ∑ → Q

- q0 is the initial state from where any input is processed (q0 ∈ Q).

- F is a set of final state/states of Q (F ⊆ Q).

So 
Q = {Q0, Q1, ...}
∑ is what arrows are on 
F can be show as like relational table / daatabase

Each character in a regular expression (that is, each character in the string describing its pattern) 
is either 
- a metacharacter, having a special meaning, 
- or a regular character that has a literal meaning

soma - cell body ( where nucleus and mitochondorion etc presents)
Axon is the fiber sticking out from soma, the end bits id the synapses after branched out.
The branches called axon termibal.

where p is like Q so p-1 is Q1
N1 N2 s are like what ∑ would present= ( where the arrow / actual value) 
The number is fixed period of time so that is relate to the position
