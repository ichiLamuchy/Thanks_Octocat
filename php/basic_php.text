PHP

TCP and etc protocol for many hand shakes on backend.

Apache is
    Popular web server software
    Httpd
    D - damon
    Apache has ability to Run on a server, lesten on 1, or multiple ip address.
    It is not uncommon for one server to have multuple network cards 
    or one network cards wwith multiple network address often for redandancy purpose.

    Let's say:
        You have 2 servers listening to one exactly the same,
        When the event of disaster, you make sure that give the back-up server that prime server's ip address, 
        so the back-up server now listening on both prime and client servers. 
        Relevantly, web server is actually configured to be listening on multiple ips

    80 denote       http
    25 denotes      mail / smtp
    21              FTP
    8000, 8080 -    people often use
    0-1024 is       reserved so should not use.
    1025-65000 -    free to  use
    
    Port number will be used recognise what service you want specifically.
    The envelop - request also contents port

    You need configure DNS - webname and ip adress

=================================================================


$_GET[]; -------------------------------------------------------
// means that what ever in the input field from browser

    $name = $_GET[‘name’];
            So it means that on the browser there would be 
            localhost/filename/fileName.php?name=Tom

            ? indicate Get method and in there name=Tom
            
    You can make html form and input as
            <form action=”fileName.php” method=”get”>
            <b> Enter Your Name </b>
            <input type = “text” name=”name”>  
            <input type = “submit”>
            </form>
            
     +++ php looks at the name attribute which corresponding to the variable inside $_GET[‘name’];
     +++ So if the name attribute was ="use" you need to set as $_GET[“user”]


$_POST[] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
// pretty the same to get method 

        $username = $_POST['userName'];
        $password = $_POST['password'];
        
        <form>
        action attribute = the php file you wrote
        method attribute "POST"
        
        <input> make sure name attribute is exactly the same as inside of $_POST[];
        
        
function ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        the same as JS
            function fn ($name)
            {
                echo "welcome".$name;
            }
            
Date & Time ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php
        
        // bool date_default_timezone_set ( string $timezone_identifier )
        // date_default_timezone_set() sets the default timezone used by all date/time functions.
            date_default_timezone_set('UTC');
        
        // Prints something like: Monday
            echo date("l");
        
        // Prints something like: Monday
            echo date("l");
