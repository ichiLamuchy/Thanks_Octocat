Using CSV file, using PHP & JS (as well as HTML and CSS etc)

Project 1: to do list

    make existing todo list
    Form to add to do ( title, description, url)
    (edit to do)
    (delete or add another valuable true or false to determine if it has been done)
    I may need to false / true on the first column
    I should be able to do as the same as adding some to the csv ( though you probably re-write all)
    Potencially think to use text file but it's all the same

    extra features add log in to see the all list but can be done later, 
    Function include delete all data, and register
