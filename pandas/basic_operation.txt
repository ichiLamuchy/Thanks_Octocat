***Basic operation of pandas***

Read file 
pd.read_csv ('') #default is comma separation where read_table need to set separation

Selecting series (column) from dataFrame can be done by [''] or dotnortation 
    - dot notation is obviously use for attribute as well so, some case it might not work.
    - dot notation can not to be used when the column name contents space
    - dot notation cannot use when you are creating new column

df['newColumnFullName'] = df.columnFirstName1 + df.columnLastName2 
    #thus is creating new column called 'newColumnFullName' on dataFrame called df

How to filter:

data[data.duration > 200] neans filter the duration > 200
    # so data shows new dataFrame where value of duration column is more than 200
    
mask = data ['columnCountryName'].str.contains('UK')
stage1 = data [mask] 
    #this mask select data (dataFrame) of where 'columnCountryName'has value of UK...
    #then gives you modified dataFrame
  

some examples: 

atage['columnName'].iloc[0] #takes the 0th row on the 'columnName' which useful for label on plt
