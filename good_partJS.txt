 =================================================================================
    
    
    
    No space between function name & ()
    One space between all other names & ()

    IEFE
    (function(){
    })();               // quite confusing look for other programmer probably
    (function(){
    }());               // better style as it makes sense
    
    Don't ever use with statement.
        there is no behaivior confirmed, it depends on param and far comfusing
        
    Always use ===
        0 ==""          // True
        0 == '0'        // True
        '' == '0'       // False
        false == '0'    // True

    Don't use ES5 string literals
    
    Always use let
    
    Global variable is evil, avoid, use all CAPITAL
    
    Do not use new prefix
    
    Always use {} in if statement
        if(a) b(); c();     // meands if (s){b();} c()
        
    var a=b= 0;  
        means 
        b = 0;
        var a = b;
    
    
JSLint style 

Bad style of JS

    ++ for Pointer arithmetic 
          we dont do it any more only C++
          Cox always security issue
      use x +=1 
          also potential to mistake with x++ & ++x
  
  
  for JS an object is a dynamic collection of properties
  Every property has a key string tha is unique within object
  
Object -------------------
  
    Everything in javascript is an object
    apart from null and undefined - sometimes called bottom value

    [key] must be string

    Delegation - differential inheritance
    using prototype instead of class, using other 

 making new object ++++++++
    Object.create(prototype)
        protopal inheritance
        
        var mother {
        a:1
        b:2
        }
        
        var daughter = Object.create(mother); point at mother object
        daughter.b +=2;  // check mothers object and put it onto daughter boject b:4
            it write on top most where it called, read can go deeper to chain where it inherid from
        Object.creat(null)  // you van make it without prototype, useful if it is just a container of stuff
        
Numbers -----------------------------------------

    there is only one number type - kinda wrong one
    64-bit binary floating point
    IEEE-754 aka double
    binary doesn't give you accuracy

    first class object means 
        stored in variable
        passed as parameter
        can be returned from function
        stored in object

        number can have method, too

    JS made the same mistake as Java made. making a separate math object (abs, log, max, min etc)
    NaN not a number
    NaN = type of number 
    NaN === NaN     // false
    isNaN(NaN)      // true


String ------------------------------------------------

    immurable
    16bit unicode caharactors
        UCS2 not quite UTF-16
    No char just string
    String literal ban be use in single or double quotes
    with \
    *** Use " for external strings      // makes sense for outside world, url, template, notes to user etc
    *** Use ' for internal strings and characters // character constant, name of property

    Convert a number to a string
        these works in the same way.
        str = num.toString();
        str = String (num);         // use this one

    Convers string to a number
        Use the number function
        Use the + prefix operator
        Use the parseInt function       // no
            num = Number (str);
            num = +str;

        parseInt() stops at the first non digit charactor
            parseInt("12em")=== 12
        The radix(10) should always be used.
            parseInt("08") === 0
            parseInt ("08", 10) === 8

        
Array ------------------------------

    array data type inherits from object (so array and object are made from the same thing!) 
    Indexes are converted to strings and used as names for retriving value
    Arrays are very efficient for sparse array but JS use pretty much dense array
    
    No need to provide a length or type when creating array
    You don't have to worry about out of bounds errors because it's not really an array. 
    It's a hashtail, so every value is in-bounds. 
    
    Arrays, unlike objects, have a special length property.
    
    sort method will be done as each element treat as string
    so 14 comes before 4
    
    delete() make the element undefind use splice to close up the gap
    
    Associative array is object!!
    Use object when names are arbitary strings
    Use arrays when sames are sequential integers

Date ----------------------------------------

    The date function is based on Jave's Date Class

Regular expression --------------------------

    https://jex.im/regulex/#!flags=&re=


Type ---------------------------------------

undefined defalt value for variable and parameters
null is also bottom varue but stick is undefined is probably good idea as that is what JS use

type of
object -    'object'
function -  'function'
array -     'object;  ******** not helping
number -    'number'
boolean -   'boolean'
null -      'object' ********** wrong it is not object
undefined - 'undefined'


JS is boolish language - all are falty or truthy
    Falsey value:
        false
        null
        undefined
        ""
        NaN
    All others are truthy including "0" "false"
    
Objust are passed by reference

Syntax ------------------
    
    comment:
    use only // coz less confusing
    
    number to string:
        Unary operator
            +"42" = 42
        Number ("42") = 42
        parseInt("42", 10) = 42
        +"3" (+"4") = 7
    
    !! makes boolish value to boolean
    
    bit wise 
    
Statement ------------------------------

     for statement 
        not really used just use forEach
    
    for in statement
        unfortunally also go through inheritated methods etc, quite messy 
        use Object,keys unstead takes object return arrays, which is just rinnumable.
    
    swich value does not need to be number in JS
        
    throw statement   
        throe new Error (reason);

        throw{
            name: exceptionName,
            message: reason
        }

    try statement
        try{  }catch(){ }
        you can have many exceptions 
 
 functions -----------------------------------------------
 
    this is JS good version
    function 
    first class
    function.prototype
    
    var statement :
        2 steps.
        1 decoration part : (hoisted) all read - undefined
        2 intialization part : assined
        
    
    funstion statement (function decoration) exactly look like function expression
        in this case of function statement
            needs
            mandatory name

        function statement is a shorthand of a var statement with function value
            
            function foo() = function foo(){};
            var foo = function foo(){};
            
           // expands to 
           var foo = undefined;
           foo = function foo() {};
           The assignment of the functionis also hoisted!!!!
           
       than is why you cannot declare a function inside if
       because it will read assigment of function outside if statement
       it actually works but (he somehow not recommend as it is out of standared)
           
    dealare all the var on the top of function
    
    Don't make function in a loop,
        it will make function every time in the loop - too expensive
        
    Examples below, for loop capture current time of div id which will be the last one
    as the div_id is out side function
        // wrong
        for (var i '''){
            div_id = divs[i].id;
            divs[i].onclick = function (){
                alert (div_id);
            };
       // right     
       divs.forEach(function (div){
        div.onclick= function(){
            alert(div.id);
        }
            
    Invocation:
   
        If too many params, etras ignored
        If too few param, the rest will be undefined
        
        No check for type, so if youn care you need to add the codes
        
    Two pseudo params
        arguments
        this

        neither s recommended

        arguments - arguments array - though as it's written it is array like object

        this - contains a reference to the object of invocation
        this allows a method to know what object it is connected with
        this allows a sigle function object to service many objects
        this is key to prototypal inheritance

           to understand this, on 4 ways to call a function

               Function form       - functionObject(arg)
                   this is set to global object (or undefined)
                   ES5 strict mode made it boud to undefine
                   either way pretty horrible
                   var that = this // when you use it inner function, so inner function can see this as that

               Method form         - thisObject.methodName(arg) 
                                   - thisObject[methodName](arg)
                   this gets bound to thisObject

               Constructor form    - new functionObject(arg)
                   this is bound to the new object
                   when a function is called with the new, a new object is created and assined to this 
                   new is operator
               
               Apply form          - functionObject.apply(thisObject, [arg])
                    this bonds to argument
                    functionObject.apply(thisObject, arhument)
                    functionObject.call(thisObject, argument...)
                    
                    a function's apply or call method allows for calling function, sxplicity specifying thisObject
                    It can also take an array of param or a seq of param
        
                +++ still not recomment to use it but need to know how people use "this" +++

   Closure -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   Lexical scoping
   Static scoping
   
   don't use all on stack, use on heap, get gabage collecter to sort stuff out
   
   function object contain a pointer to the codes so it knows what to excute when function is invoked.
   and function object will contain a reference to the activation of the function that created it
   
    
  Pseudoclassical Inheritance ****** Get out from misery --------------------------------
  
  This is how JS programmeer codes (AWFUL)!!
             
        function Gizmo (id){
            this.id = id;
        }
        Gizmo.prototype.toString = function (){
            return "gizmo" + this.id;
        };
        
        function Hoozit (id){
            this.id = id;
        }
        Hoozit.prototype = new Gizmo();
        Hoozit.prototype.test = function (id){
            return this.id === id;
        };
    
    
        using Gismo constructor and making test methon on prototype and tec, 
        quite mess what points where
        
        people know there is something lacking 
        
        
        Sugar coating Sudoclassical System in order to amke it better
        
        you can make little function (check under new_constructor Crockford's)
