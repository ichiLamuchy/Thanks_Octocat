Traceroute is a command which can show you the path a packet of information takes from your computer to one you specify. 
It will list all the routers it passes through until it reaches its destination, 
or fails to and is discarded. In addition to this, 
it will tell you how long each 'hop' from router to router takes.

The traceroute command utilizes the IP protocol "time to live" field 
and attempts to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response from each gateway along the path to some host.
