How Contents are delivered via CDN

1:
consumer issues a request for the resource http://oooo.com 
The browser of that consumer will first contact its local DNS resolver 
for IP address of http://oooo.com for the content delivery.

2:
A DNS based proxy (Resource Router ) in CDN server will redirect such DNS query to appropriate edge caches. 
The Request Router takes into account factors other than geographic location of the consumer 
(which is identified by the query’s source IP address); 
it considers the load of existing edge cache servers as well, 
and probably some other proprietary selection criteria. 

3:
After an appropriate edge cache is identified, 
the Request Router returns its corresponding IP address to the client’s local resolver.

4:
Then the consumer’s browser subsequently contacts the edge cache for the content. 

If the edge cache needs to contact the original producer for any reason, 
the edge cache server will contact the appropriate producer server 
to fetch this information or perform these checks.
