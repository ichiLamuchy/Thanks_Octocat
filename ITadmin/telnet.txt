connect to host server with telnet on comand (or whatever) prompt then it will tells you if connected
SSH is better though but telnet may work within the local network 



Telnet is a protocol that allows you to connect to remote computers (called hosts) 
over a TCP/IP network (such as the Internet). 

Telnet client software allows a computer to connect to a remote computer. 
Telnet server software allows telnet clients to connect to a server, log in to that server, and run applications.

Using telnet client software on your computer, 
you can make a connection to a telnet server (i.e., the remote host). 
Once your telnet client establishes a connection to the remote host, 
your client becomes a virtual terminal, 
allowing you to communicate with the remote host from your computer. In most cases, 
you'll need to log into the remote host, which requires that you have an account on that system. 
Occasionally, you can log in as guest or public without having an account.

Telnet clients are available for all major operating systems.

There are variety of ways to use telnet
    example 1:
        PuTTY is often use for telnet client software (can be used for many others)
        just put host ip address and pott (normally 23)
        then you can use PuTTY prompt

        Using thing like wireshark to see the all session of telnet 
        pretty risky as you can see everything so you can set SSH instead of telnet on server side (such as freeSSHd)
        to make it encrypted (run on 22)

    example2 
        telnet whateveripserver 23 
            on command prompt (on windows, linux, mac)
            The last digit is port nember
