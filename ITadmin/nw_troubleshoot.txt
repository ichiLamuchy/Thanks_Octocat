===========================================

Basic comsept is go up from layer 1 physical layer

1. Visual check
    Cable, wire text etc
    
2. gather information tools

    ipconfig 
        to see your ip address
                    default gataway
                    DNS server    and etc
                    
    arp -a 
        to get list of mac address with associate ip address in your arp cache
        so if you don't see the ip address on the list, just ping it so it will go onto the cache 
        then when you arp -a again, it will be added onto the list
        this way you can get the mac address of the ip address
        
        
        
 3. ping <hostname> (ICMP)
    to check the host is alive and you can get icmp responce back.
    
    if not, 
    you could ping gataway to see if you are able to go outside your local net work.
    
 
 4. traceroute <hostname>
        (apparently you can apply on both layer 2 and 3??)
        utelize ip protocall TTL - check time from each gataway.
        defalt is ICMP you can "UDP traceroute", too
        Check the time of HOP
 
 
 5. nslookup <hostname> (in windows) (TCP/IP)
        
        tells you info about the DNS server,
        CName, A (address), Alies and stc
        
        
        nslookup -A <ip address>
            lookup names

        nslookup -a <names> // if you don't know the ip address
            it gives the same info as above also gives ip address
            
      
 
 6. dig (TCP/IP)
        similler to nslookup
        slight more info such as how long it took to cache
