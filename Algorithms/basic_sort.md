Just a quick note:

### Selection sort  

find smallest element then swap to the very left undorted part
both big O and Ω is quadratic runtime - simple array x 2

### Bubble sort

higher value to right, lower  value to the left. 
since it satartd from very left, the highest value will be sorted. 
use swap counter to track that - so you do not need unnecesary comparation when it's sorted 
big O - n<sup>2</sup> and Ω n

### Inserton sort

Sort from the banch on the left group
shift the higher value and insert the lower value

big O - n<sup>2</sup> and Ω n

### Merge sort  

split the full array to sub arrays from left to right.  
make all down to one so that is naturally sorted
merge them back do all over until it become all

n log n 

### Linear Serch

just find an element in array
big O - n and Ω 1

### Binary search

only array is sorted 
big O - log n and Ω 1
