1596 Metamorphosis of Ajax about toilet

DOM ---------------------------------
    h1, h2 p tag on on the same revel

        #document       -document
            HTML        - document.documentElement
                Head
                Body    - document.body
                    H1
                    P
                    H2
                    P
     
     HTML - document.documentElement
        // as W3 was gonna kill HTML element
     Body - document.body // this is a short cut
     it's all ponters
     You canot edit the DOM tree, it is read only from your perspective
     YOu need to use DOM API to edit it
     You don't really need all the pointers if you think of how recursion works
     All you need is binary tree (2 pointers)
     childNode ais like array
 
 Retrieving Node ------------------------------
 
 document.setElementById etc
 then node.propertyName = "whatever" to reassign new 
 stick with common propery not unique ones on separate browser
 
 node.className // should really called .class 
 
 node.style.styleName
 
 CSS and DOM has totally non-comnpatable way of naming
 you need to know where you are in CSS or in DOM?
 
    CSS                 DOM
    background-coor     backgroundColor
    border-radius       boarderRadius
    font-size           fontSize
    list-style-type     listStyleType
    word-spacing        wordSpacing 
    z-index             zIndex
    float               cssFloat
    
    
    createElement()
    createTextNode()
    cloneNode()     // doesnt come with things such as attached event handler
    cloneNode(true) // including children
    
    you need to connect to dom to be visible
    
    node.appendChild()
    node.insertBefore()
    node.replaceChild(new, old)
    old.paretsNode.replaceChild(new, old) // another java style :O
    node.removeChild(old)
    
    IE:
    if attach event handler to node, the node won't get gabage collected 
    you must remove all the event handler from node before you remove the node from tree
    migt get fixed in IE9
