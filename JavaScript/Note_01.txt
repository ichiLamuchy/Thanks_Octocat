  }());
  variables inside is protected and not affected

Object
  whern you access to name of the object with [], you need to add ''
  Person.name == Person['name']
  function is a object too
  
prototype inheritance
  every object have one
  console.log(functionName.__proto__)to show prototype properties
  
function costruntors (start with capital letter)
  the this variable point to a new empty object
  new is operator in JS, so key worrd new makes new {} then the this point to the object
  and the object return from the function automativcally
