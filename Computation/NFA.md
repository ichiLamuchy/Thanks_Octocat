## Non Determonistic Finite Automata


let's compare to DFA
Determistic Finite Automata
    Detaminism

    >> In DFA given current state we will know where the next state will be
    >> it ahs only one unique next state
    >> It has no choises or randomness
    >> It his simple and easy to design

Non-detamisitic Final Automata
Non-Detaminism

>> In NFA, given the current state there could be multiple next stages    
>> The next stages may be chosen at random
>> All the next states may be chosen parallel
>> there is Îµ choice which is empty string
